A data interchange format for Bible-centric content. Supports licenses, multimedia project data...

## History

This proposal has been prepared by the ETEN Project Portability Working Group which was
formed after meetings in Philadelphia in July 2018. The group has since met several times
virtually, culminating in two days of face meetings in Orlando on January 17-18, 2019. The
meeting was attended by

* Han Chung
* Jesse Griffin
* Mark Howe
* Joel Mathew
* Tim Steenwyk
* Benjamin Varghese
* Andi Wu

## Scope

The original focus of the group was specific to translation project portability between translation
applications. This focus has been broadened to include any Bible-centric content and the entire
ecosystem, including publication. Further, the intent is not to create new data formats
unnecessarily, but rather define a portable way of interchanging existing formats between
applications and ecosystems. This necessarily includes existing and future client/server
architectures and the attendant need to uniquely identify users, organizations and content.
Because of the enlarged scope, the group is now known as the Scripture Burrito (SB) Working
Group.

## Goal

Lossless portability of Scripture-related metadata and data between translation and publication
users, applications and ecosystems.

## Features

* a single container format to span the entire Scripture life cycle, from translation, through
community testing and checking, to publication
* support for canonical and quasi-canonical translations in multiple media (initially text,
audio, video, print on demand and braille)
* support for a wide range of resources relating to scripture, such as lexicons,
cross-references, translation manuals, and commentaries
* mechanisms for linking related content, both at a burrito-to-burrito and
ingredient-to-ingredient level
* identification of people, organizations and content via namespaced ids relating to multiple
authenticating servers

## Formats

The proposal describes a recipe for assembling a burrito by organizing ingredients into a specific,
hierarchical structure. That structure could be represented as nested directories on a filesystem, or
as a ZIP file, or in any other system-dependent way.

## Metadata

The proposed format is based on the forthcoming DBL Metadata 2.3, which already offers many of
the desired features. SB Metadata 0.1 has an XML and a JSON expression . Content servers may
store SB metadata in either format and should allow metadata input and output for any burrito in
either format. SB 0.1 will include features present in unfoldingWord Resource Container metadata,
including better support for public licences and non-scriptural content.

## Canonical Text

The proposal is to support both USFM and USX, since significant existing ecosystems use both
expressions. Content servers may store canonical text in either or both formats and should allow
input and output of any burrito in either format. USFM/USX v3.0 is preferred, but older versions
will be supported and declared via the format section of the metadata.

## Other Ingredient Formats

Existing standards should be embraced where possible. Legacy character-based markup
schemes should be deprecated in favour of popular, modern formats such as XML and JSON.
(Versification schemes are one example requiring urgent attention.)

## Supporting Technologies

* USFM ↔ USX convertors in C#, Javascript and Python
* Metadata XML ↔ JSON convertors in C#, Javascript and Python
* Modular, RESTful interfaces for supporting server technology

## Building

Install the sphinx engine

    sudo apt-get install python-sphinx

Then run the build script from the docs/ directory.

> NOTE: this top level makefile is just a shorcut to building the html.

    make

## Format

The docs are written in [reStructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/rest.html), processed by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html), and hosted online by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

See the [reStructuredText Primer](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/rest.html) and the [Docutils reStructuredText Directives](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html) documentation to learn how to use the syntax.

## Validation

There is a build script intended for a continuous integration system to run which validates the XML examples provided.

### Dependencies

You can run this locally but you first need to install the [rnc2rng](https://github.com/djc/rnc2rng) python package and ensure that you have `xmllint` available on your system. You can install `rnc2rng` by running `pip install rnc2rng`, this should work for Python 2 or 3 on any system with `pip` available.

To install `xmllint` on an Ubuntu based system, try `sudo apt-get install -y libxml2-utils`. This utility may be available on Mac OSX out of the box or as a part of Xcode Command Line Tools.

### Running

Once dependencies are satisfied, you can run `./cibuild.sh` and each file in the docs/examples/directory will be run through `xmllint` and checked against the schema. The script will output errors found and exit non-zero after the *first invalid file*. Hence, after fixing the first file with errors there may be subsequent files that are found to be invalid as well.
