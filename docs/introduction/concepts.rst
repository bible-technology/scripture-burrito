Flavors are typically quite broadly defined. Additional constraints may be added using **conventions**. For example, an audio convention may specify that 
audio files represent whole chapters of Scripture, or that they are arranged according to a specific hierarchy. Burrito creators should respect any
convention they include in the metadata. Burrito consumers may use conventions to decide how or whether to process a burrito. The semantics of no specified
conventions is *caveat emptor*, ie nothing should be assumed about the content of the burrito beyond what is specified for the burrito flavor.
