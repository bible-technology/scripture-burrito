Use Cases

#. Scripture Burrito is designed first and foremost for **data interchange** between ecosystems, although creators and consumers may also choose to use some or all of the format internally.

#. Scripture Burrito is **a Bible-lifespan format**. In other words, it is intended to be used from the start of the translation, through checking and community testing, into publication via multiple toolchains, and then through revision processes.

#. Scripture Burrito supports **non-text formats as first-class content**. In other words, the model is not "text plus multimedia". In some cases text may play a secondary role or even be absent (eg in the case of oral translation or sign-language projects).

#. Scripture Burrito assumes the existence of **ecosystem servers** that provide ids for users, organizations and projects, and stores information to enable that server-hosted context to be discovered.

#. Scripture Burrito is intended to allow **lossless roundtripping of projects between ecosystems**. This depends to some extent on references to ecosystem servers that enable reconnection with different ecosystem-specific contexts.

#. Scripture Burrito supports **Scripture content** (original languages and translations), but also **Scriptural content** (eg glosses) and **Scripture-related content** (eg commentaries, translation manuals).
