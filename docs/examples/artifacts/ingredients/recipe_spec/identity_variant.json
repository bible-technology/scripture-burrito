    "en": "This is an identity transform in the XSLT sense, ie it gives you back what you started with, except for the license (which, in a generic solution, would be specified in the source, not here). It uses shortcuts to 'move everything'. See the other identity variant example for how to have fine-grained control of the process. This is how we would 'publish' a 'source' project."
