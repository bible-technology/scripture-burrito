Scripture Burrito Documentation
===============================

.. image:: ../logo/burrito_logo.png

After several years of development and testing, we are pleased to announce the availability of **Scripture Burrito 1.0.0** specification! We recommend that developers of Scripture and Scripture-related applications test and adopt this specification for interchanging data with other systems. Out of the box Scripture Burrito is designed to support the following types of data:

- :ref:`scripture_text_flavor`
- :ref:`scripture_print_flavor`
- :ref:`scripture_audio_flavor`
- :ref:`scripture_sign_language_flavor`
- :ref:`scripture_braille_flavor`
- :ref:`scriptural_text_stories_flavor`

As interoperability is our primary goal, we are happy to accept proposals for new flavors based on common interchange scenarios. We have provided instructions and examples for :ref:`extending_scripture_burrito` by testing and implementing new flavors (using ``x-`` flavors). When multiple implementations can be demonstrated, we will consider adding them as official flavors in new schema releases.

If you learn best by example, see the `minimal flavor examples <https://github.com/bible-technology/sb_minimalFlavorExamples>`_.

This work has been a multi-year collaboration between several organizations, including `American Bible Society <https://americanbible.org/>`_, `Clear.Bible <https://www.clear.bible/>`_, `Eldarion <https://eldarion.com/>`_, `Bridge Connectivity Solutions <https://bridgeconn.com/>`_, `SIL <https://www.sil.org/>`_, `unfoldingWord <https://www.unfoldingword.org/>`_, `United Bible Societies <https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/>`_, and the work has been sponsored by `illumiNations <https://illuminations.bible/>`_.
