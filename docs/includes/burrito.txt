A **burrito** is a wrapper that contains content and metadata. That wrapper may be made available in various digital formats, such as a zip file, an Amazon S3 bucket or a series of API calls. The term “burrito” describes the wrapper, not the distribution mechanism.

The metadata describes the contents of the burrito, including directory structure and ingredients.
