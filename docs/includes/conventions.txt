Flavors are typically quite broadly defined. Additional constraints may be added using **conventions**, which are expressed in the metadata using the schema. For example, an audio convention may specify that audio files represent whole chapters of Scripture, or that they are arranged according to a specific hierarchy. Burrito creators should respect any convention they include in the metadata. Burrito consumers may use conventions to decide how or whether to process a burrito. The semantics of no specified conventions is *caveat emptor*, i.e. nothing should be assumed about the content of the burrito beyond what is specified for the burrito flavor.
