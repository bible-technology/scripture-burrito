This flavor is in **beta** and we are actively seeking feedback.

=======
History
=======

The Scripture Print flavor is based on the Digital Bible Library's print entry type, which was initially developed as a way to archive projects generated by Publishing Assistant, and to make such projects available through industry standard print on demand vendors. The metadata has been through several iterations, in discussion with POD vendors.

POD assumes a fixed page layout that must conform to various printing requirements. PDFs are ideal for this, but do not allow text to be "reflowed" for novel publishing scenarios. Scripture Burrito therefore adds a variant, based on InDesign Tagged Text, that allows publishers to use fully marked-up text within containers of their choice.

The "source" section of print flavors requires more work. In DBL, print entries follow Paratext-created text entries, providing the entire source as a zip file. This is opaque, and should be replaced with a more transparent and intentional resource structure, as for Scripture Burrito's scriptureText flavor.

Conventions

........
paLegacy
........

The presence of this convention confirms that the ingredients are structured according to DBL's legacy structure, ideal

* the content in release/Inside.pdf

* the printable cover in release/Cover.pdf

* optionally, a thumbnail in release/CoverThumbnail.jpg

The absence of this convention means that nothing maybe assumed about the name or location of any resources. (This should not matter to Scripture Burrito tool chains which should use the scopeOrRole fields to determine semantics.)
