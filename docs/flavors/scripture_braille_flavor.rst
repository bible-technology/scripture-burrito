Scripture Braille

======
Status

The Scripture Text flavor is based on the Digital Bible Library's text entry type. DBL developed the metadata and content formats in close collaboration with Compass Braille (https://www.compassbraille.org/), a British registered charity that has produced most of the braille editions of United Bible Societies texts.

The metadata format closely reflects Compass Braille's current tool chain, to a point where that metadata can be used to generate a braille entry from a DBL text entry. The next step is to consult with other braille Bible stakeholders in order to incorporate their needs.

Content
=======

* Ready-to-emboss braille volumes in Portable Embosser Format, an XML vocabulary (http://pef-format.org/) based on braille unicode.

* Source files in Bible Braille Markup (BBM), which is PEF plus namespaced extensions which are intended to permit last-resort reflowing of PEF.
